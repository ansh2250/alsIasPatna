                    <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

                    <p><b>In Short:</b>We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organisational and technical security measures.</p>

                    <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organisational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>

                    <span class="p-2 text-dark bg-warning mt-5"> DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</span><hr>

                    <p><b>In Short:</b> do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.</p>
                    <p>We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependentâ€™s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at info@alsias.net.</p>


                    <span class="p-2 text-dark bg-warning mt-5">WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</span> <hr>

                    <p><b>Withdrawing your consent:</b> If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section 'HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?' below.</p>

                    <p>However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>

                    <p><b>Opting out of marketing and promotional communications: </b>You can unsubscribe from our marketing and promotional communications at any time by or by contacting us using the details provided in the section 'HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?' below.

                    <span class="p-2 text-dark bg-warning mt-5">CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</span> <hr>
                    <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ('DNT') feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognising and implementing DNT signals has been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>

                    <span class="class p-2 text-dark bg-warning mt-5">DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</span> <hr>

                    <p><b>In Short: Yes, we will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws.</b></p>
                    <p>We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated 'Revised' date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material changes to this privacy notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this privacy notice frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.</p>
